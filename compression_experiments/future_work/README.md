# Future Work: Video Compression

In future versions of this project, we plan to implement video compression and decompression using:

- H.264 (via FFmpeg or OpenCV)
- ML-based approaches such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Transformer-based codecs

This will allow comparison with text/image compression and provide insights into performance across different media types.

Future metrics may include:

- Video bitrate
- Frame-level PSNR and SSIM
- Temporal consistency
